# Fresnel Calculator

It helps you calculate the 3rd Fresnel Radius, Distance from 3rd fresnel, Allowance due to Earths Curve, and also the Radio Tilt by only entering the values of Distance 1 and 2, Frequency and Lower and Higher radio total elevation.

## What is Fresnel Clearance Zone?
Fresnel Zone is one of a series of confocal prolate ellipsoidal regions of space between and around a transmitting antenna and a receiving antenna system.

D is the distance between the transmitter and the receiver; r is the radius of the first Fresnel zone (n = 1) at point P. P is d1 away from the transmitter, and d2 away from the receiver.
